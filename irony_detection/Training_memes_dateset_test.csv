When men routinely groped and sexually harassed women in 1980 the workplace with impunity (watch old Cagney and Lacey reruns), Republicans voted against a bill that would've allowed women to report sexual harassment in the workplace. 1994 When news about domestic violence became an issue and right wing radio hosts were arguing men should have the ""right"" to rape their wives, Republicans voted against the Violence Against Women Act. 2012 As the knowledge that men are paid more than women became widespread in America, Republicans voted as a block against the Equal Pay For Equal Work For Women Act. 2012 When the violence Against Women Act was brought up for reauthorization, Republicans again voted against it. 2022 Today Republicans across the country are fighting to prevent women from having access to abortion care, and are proposing legislation in state after state to ban birth control and roll back any of the previously mentioned laws.
